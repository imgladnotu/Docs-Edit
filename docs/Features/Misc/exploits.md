# Exploits

Exploits will use unintended game behavior to your advantage.

---

## Anti Autobalance

Prevents you from being moved to the other team by automatically reconnecting to the server.

## sv_cheats Bypass

Bypasses the restrictions that `sv_cheats` enforces on your side. This allows you to execute commands which would normally not be accessible.
You cannot use this to run serversides cheat commands (`noclip` for example).

## Noisemaker Spam

Keeps spamming your equipped noisemaker without reducing its charges.

## Ping reducer

Reduces the ping that you and other people can see on the scoreboard. This can be helpful in combination with fake latency, so you can have a high backtrack window while maintaining a low ping on the scoreboard. The ping reducer does not actually reduce your ping to the server!
